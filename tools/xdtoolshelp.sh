Options:
    full        Full resync: delete the whole source tree, do a sync and 
                fully resync local tree
    repo        Partial resync: only resync specified repository:
                    Deletes the specified repository from the source tree
                    and syncs it

    repo-local  Partial local resync: only resync specified repository locally:
                    Deletes the specified repository from the source tree and
                    syncs it locally.
    full-x      Totally full resync: delete the whole source tree, delete all
                repositories from .repo and does a full network resync.
                !! WARNING: This will delete all your synced repositories and
                !!          resync the whole source from scratch! Please make
                !!          sure you know what you are doing!
    repo-x      Totally modular resync: Deletes the repository from source tree
                and also removes project files and objects. This will cause
                the repository you have specified to be completely downloaded
                again.
                
Example: reporesync repo-x packages/apps/Settings android_packages_apps_Settings
            This removes packages/apps/Settings and the repository including
            object files and project files.
        
         reporesync full
            This does a sync and resyncs the local work tree. Deletes everything
            except .repo and does a sync.
            
Additional:
    Use the low argument anywhere in the command after <option> to sync faster
    on low bandwidth. Example: reporesync full low
